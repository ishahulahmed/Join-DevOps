Session Overview
-----------------
a) MySQL
b) Backend
c) Frontend
d) Public vs private IP
e) Forward vs Reverse proxy

Launch 3 Instances --> RHEL-9 --> Launch Instance
use expense-documentation --> https://github.com/daws-78s/expenses-documention

Inside the database server we have schemas. In schemas we have tables.
you can use Mobaxterm if super putty is not working. due some OS issues for few OS super putty is not working.

even you can use git bash ssh ec2-user@ip-address

Take sudo access and follow expense documentation to install mysql, backend and frontend.

first install db as per documentation [take sudo access sudo su or sudo su -]

systemctl start mysqld
after starting mysqld using the above command password will empty for mysql server. so we are setting a password for it.
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1 [here username is root and we are setting up the root password as ExpenseApp@1]

we will use following commands during troubleshooting: [to check whethere db is running or not]
systemctl status mysqld 
netstat -lntp --> 3306 port should be opened for mysql
ps -ef | grep mysqld

mysql [just mysql and enter then you will connect to the database if everythign configured correctly]
show databases;
exit

Setup Backend as per documentation. Take sudo access first.
Now, days version releases are coming faster. so, our operating systems are supporting multiple version. we can enable the version which we want and use it and disable other versions which are not needed.

dnf module disable nodejs -y [this will disable the 18 version inside our server siva said] [we know it will disable all the versions]

versions and programming lanaguages these decisions are taken by architects.

we are creating an user for this application only
useradd expense

curl -o (here -o means output)

curl -o /tmp/backend.zip https://expense-builds.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/expense-backend-v2.zip
here, we are storing the zip file /tmp/backend
you can use wget also but for flexibility we are using curl here

you don't need to understand node.js development. you need to understand node.js structure.
we are not windows operating system developers. but, we know how windows works as we know its structure.

In Job Description if there is Java means. it doesn't mean you need to know java. it means you need java structure.

NodeJS Structure
--------------------
.js files --> java script files
package.json -> developers mention the dependencies and thier version
	        it is a build file also.
every language will have one build file [pom.xml like in java]
package.json --> nodejs
pom.xml --> java
requirements.txt --> python

all programming languages principles are same even though their languages are different. In those principles these build file etc is also one principle.
 
install the dependencies --> npm install [in which folder you are running this command. it will read the package.json in that folder and install its dependencies]

if dependencies are not downloaded properly our code will not work.

why we need to give priavte-ip? [in backend.service why we give db private-ip]
if we take a home netowrk there will be a modem and all other devices like laptop, computer and mobile etc are connected to modem wifi.

if you enter facebook.com in your laptop first request will go to the modem. it will check if facebook.com servers in our network.
do you think facebook.com is in our home? No. so, request needs to go out. so, model will send request to isp (internet service provider). 
if you give a domain or ip-address which is not in the network (i.e your home network). modem responsibility is simply sending that request to isp from there isp will handle that request.

here, modem will have two interfaces
1. public 
2. private

in your command prompt if you give ipconfig [windows cmd]
Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.104  --> this is my ip-address
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1

but if you go into internet and search for what is my ip address
https://whatismyipaddress.com/ --> it will give your ip information
My IP Address is:
IPv4: ? 49.204.197.154

My IP Information:
ISP: Beam Telecom Pvt Ltd
City: Akkarampalle
Region: Andhra Pradesh
Country: India

192.168.0.104 --> this is private-ip address
49.204.197.154 --> this is public-ip address this is given by isp

49.204.198.60 --> this is public-ip address shown to siva same used in diagram.

49.204.197.154 --> this is the ip-adress for your entire network [i.e home network and devices connected to that network see diagram]

why we have like this means this is a concept of NAT. (Network Address Translation)

previously, for every sytem there was a ip-address. but, you know what happened Ipv4 got exhausted. so the designers thought if we keep on giving a ip-address for every system our ip-address range will get exhausted.

NAT
2^32 total IP Address [this is the IPv4 range]
IPV4 exhausted

So, they started giving one ip-address for an netowrk [like you homenetwork one ip-address]
So, mobile, laptop, computer everythig ip-address is same i.e 49.204.198.60 as per diagram this is called network address translation.
if communication is happening with in your network then it will be through private ip-address but if it is going out then communication will happen through public ip-address this is called network address translation.

Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1 [this is the gateway our modem ip]
  Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.104
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1

In your network configuration, the "Default Gateway" refers to the device that routes traffic from your local network to external networks, such as the internet. In your case, the default gateway is set to 192.168.0.1, which is typically the IP address of your router. When your device needs to send data outside of your local network, it forwards that data to the gateway, which then directs it to its destination.

previously, in IRCTC from ip-address only two tickets can be booked. [i.e in your entire home how many devices also you use only two tickets because all devices are connected to same network modem]

if you are searching internet for example any malicious sites or terrorist sites 49.204.198.60 this ip-address will be logged in your isp [i.e modem-ip address] then they can find out who visited those sites easily.

This ip-address [modem] isp will keep on changing it [don't after how much time]. if you need the same ip-address then we have to pay isp 1000rs extra per month.

systemcl status backed will show failed because you have just given ip-address but no username and password in backend.service file
we have create database server but no table and schema is created. if you give directly to store how can it store without you creating schema and table.
if i tell to store in wadrobe it cannot store. we have to tell which shelf to store in that wadrobe as an intruction.

we are running operation from backend to database to store data in db.

mysql-server --> this is server
mysql --> client

Linux --> Server
Putty --> SSH client

facebook.com --> http server
browser --> http client

so, for every server there will be a client software. database admin will create databases they will not give root access to database they will give you some client access. i.e you can connect from other server to this db.

we cannot go and connect directly to the server. we will install a client package in other server from that client we will connect to the main server. 
so, we are installing mysql client package in our server.
dnf install mysql -y

after installing mysql client there is file in /app/schema/backend.sql let us see what is there in it
cat /app/schema/backend.sql

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS transactions; [we are creating a db or schema in a server]
USE transactions; [using that db]

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions ( [creating table]
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount INT,
    description VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'expense'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ExpenseApp@1'; [creating an user]
GRANT ALL ON transactions.* TO 'expense'@'%'; [informing mysql server to give this user previliges]
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

expense
ExpenseApp@1
these credentials are used by our nodejs application to connect. these username and password we have already configure in our nodejs code

DbConfig.js [this is the cofiguration we set in our code in DbConfig.js file]
module.exports = Object.freeze({
    DB_HOST : '',
    DB_USER : 'expense',
    DB_PWD : 'ExpenseApp@1',
    DB_DATABASE : 'transactions'
});


mysql -h 172.31.17.214 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql
This mysql commnad is connecting to the 172.31.45.116 [mysql-ip-address] with root username [-u means username we gave it as root] and its password ExpenseApp@1 [-p means password we set it as ExpenseApp@1] anad loading this schema  present in location /app/shema/backend.sql

it is loading that schema means it is running the sql commands present in backend.sql

run this  command 
mysql -h 172.31.17.214 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql

after, running this command how to know whether executed or not
mysql -h 172.31.17.214 -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 [run this command you will get]
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

so, we have connected to db successfully from our backend server. now we need start our application then our backend service will run.
systemctl start backend
systemctl status backend [active]

if, we got a problem like our application is unable to connect to database. we will ping the db-ip-address
ping 172.31.17.214 [it will ping nonstop]
ping -c 3 172.31.17.214 [now it will ping 3 times]

3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2030ms
0% packet loss means backend server is able to reach database server.

just like to check whether internet is working or not will ping in cmd [windows]
ping google.com [in cmd this will ping 3 times only]

backend should be able to connect DB server on port no 3306

telnet <IP-Address> <port-no>

backend apps usually run on port no 8080

Nginx --> Engine-X
-----
http web server
reverse proxy
port no --> 80

/usr/share/nginx/html --> this is where we need to keep our frontend website

/etc/nginx --> Home directory of nginx

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --> this is the nginx config file

/var/log/nginx/error.log --> this is the location nginx stores logs

/usr/share/nginx/html --> if you keep index.html. that will be served by default


proxy_http_version 1.1;

location /api/ { proxy_pass http://172.31.32.178:8080/; }

location /health {
  stub_status on;
  access_log off;
}


what is proxy?
-----------------
some one on behalf of you == proxy

VPN will change our location to US...

Forward Proxy
----------------
clients are aware of VPN, but servers are not aware

mobile is aware of VPN

company VPN
---------------
restrict the websites
monitor the user requests

Reverse Proxy
-----------------
clients are not aware of proxy/VPN, only servers are aware

SSL termination

domain
google.com
facebook.com
twitter.com

DNS --> Domain name system

dictionary for domains

google.com = 123.48.55.77

first we need to buy domain

provider
godaddy

sometimes hostiger will ask for 5000rs... autopay

you will pay only max 200rs.

I should transfer my domain to AWS...
