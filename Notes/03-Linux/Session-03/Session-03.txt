recap
---------
public key vs private key
generated keys
created security group
launched EC2
connected
practiced few commands

rm daws-78s.pem daws-78s.pub (removing more than one file at a time)

copy
----------
select the file | ctrl+c + ctrl+v

cp <source-file> <destination-path>

/etc --> passwd (there is a file in /etc named paasswd)

cp /etc/passwd . (in linx . means current working directory)
cp /etc/passwd /home/ec2-user/
cp /etc/passwd users (copying passwd file from /etc as users in current working directory)
cp /etc/passwd devops/users (copying passwd file to devops folder with name as users)


cut
-----------
select the file | ctrl+x + ctrl+v

mv <source-file> <destination-path>

mv sample devops/ (moving sample file to devops folder)

mkdir cloud
cd cloud
touch example
cd ..

cp cloud devops (Trying to copy cloud folder to devops this will not copy any files)
cp: omitting directory ‘cloud’

cp -r cloud devops (These will copy recursively entire cloud folder and its files into devops folder)

mv cloud devops (moves cloud folder into devops folder)

mv users user-list (Renaming)
(here moving the technically inthe same directory there is  no user-list. so, here we are renamis users as user-list)

grep
-----------
used to search for a word in file

grep <word-to-find> <which-file>

grep ec2-user user-list
ec2-user:x:1000:1000:EC2 Default User:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

grep ec2-User user-list (no Output Since Linux is case sensitive and there is no word with U capital in ec2-User)

grep -i ec2-User user-list (here we are telling with -i be case insensitive)
ec2-user:x:1000:1000:EC2 Default User:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

Piping
-------
1st Pipe Output will be Second Pipe Input (see diagram)
| -> pipe symbol

cat user-list | grep ec2-user (here file name not given but output of 1st command acted as input of second command)
ec2-user:x:1000:1000:EC2 Default User:/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

curl and wget
---------------
in windows --> example git bash download --> go to git bash site --> click on downloads --> click on git bash download link
in linux we use wget

wget -> web get 
wget <file-url>
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.44.0.windows.1/Git-2.44.0-64-bit.exe

wget is used to download files and folder or softwares into linux server

curl is used to get the text directly on to the terminal

curl <file-url>
curl git-hub-file-raw-url (use git hub raw url if use direct file ure it will get along with contents it html, css and js structure)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-78s/notes/main/session-02.txt | grep ls
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3824  100  3824    0     0  42446      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 42966
ls --> list subdirectories
ls -l --> long format
ls -lr --> reverse alphabetical order
ls -lt --> latest files
ls -ltr --> starts from old files
ls -la --> all files and directory including hidden
ls --> read

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-78s/notes/main/session-02.txt (This will download the file)


cut and awk
------------
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-78s/notes/main/session-02.txt

Siva kumar reddy = siva, kumar, reddy
space is called as delimiter

https: <empty> raw.githubusercontent.com daws-78s notes main session-02.txt

cut command is used to get the fragments of a text using delimiter

cut -d "/" -f1

awk command
-----------
awk command is used text processing..generally used to divide the text in column format

awk -F "/" '{print $1F}'

awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'

head and tail
--------------
head --> gives first 10lines of the file
tail --> last 10 lines of the file

Editor
------------
vi and vim

vim advanced version of vi

vim <file-name>
Colon/Command mode
---------------
:q --> Quit, to come out of the file
:q! --> force quit, dont save the changes, quit the file
:wq --> write and quit
:set nu
:/<word-to-find> --> search the word from top
:?<word-to-find> --> search the word from bottom
:noh --> remove focus i.e nohighlight
:%d --> delete everything

:s/bin/BIN --> replace in the line where your cursor is
:%s/bin/BIN --> replace in every line, but only first occurence
:<line-no>s/<word-to-find>/<replace-word>/g --> first occurence in that line, if you want global(all occurences in that line) just give g
:%s/<word-to-find>/<replace-word>/gi --> all occurences in the file
