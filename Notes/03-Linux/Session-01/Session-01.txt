What is DevOps?

Book or Internet Answer --> DevOps = Development + Operations 

What is computer?
	Laptop/Desktop/Mobile/Server == Computing Device
	
	Processor
	Ram
	Storage
	OS = Graphics + Kernel = Linux not windows (OS for Servers)
	Why servers will not have graphics 

Laptop/Desktop = Internet surfing + Development + Songs + movies = daily use
Mobile = Apps + Internet + calling
Server = to server the application

more graphics = more memory + more power + more time

Server = less memory + less power + less AC + less time + less cost (it should consume)
Servers are more powerful to server many requests as they have more powerful Processor + Ram + Storage

Client and Server
-------------------
in or internet world, everything is a computer

we have a Lawyer , we are clients for him

legal service, so we are clients

who gives info = service provider
who requests info = client

client server not on the basis of size but on the basis of request and service

laptop = client (diagram)
server = facebook

laptop = client (diagram)
mobile = server

mobile = client (diagram)
laptop = server

What is DevOps?
-----------------

before independence
--------------------
stakeholders --> who are part of system
school = students, parents, teachers

ideally 100% students should get pass

only one final exam 50 years back

student = he will not study from DAY-1
teachers = teachers may not focus to complete syllabus from DAY-1
parents = they always worried about their children from DAY-1

clients == parents

pass percentage was very less

30 years back
--------------------
unit-I, unit-II, quarterly, unit-III, Half yearly, unit-IV, grand test and final test

student = student may start study JUL 1st week
teachers = teachers will start focus on lessons
parents = they will wait until JUL 3rd week

everybody will analyse results.

100 --> 30 members got 31% (33% is needed to Pass), 69% (69% passed)

unit-II --> 72%
III --> 75%
Final --> 95% (Here there are 7 Chances before final exam for the students to improve) (here parents need not worry till last exam like previous)

15 year back
-------------------
daily slip tests

DAY-1 we teach something
DAY-2 we will conduct exam, max 5 questions

students = they start studying from DAY-1
teachers =  they start teaching from DAY-1
parents = they can see results from DAY-1

99.99%

process improvement is the key for best results

whatsapp --> 2011
whatsapp --> 2024

process improvement happened in whatsapp system...

SDLC --> Software Development Lifecycle
Requirements gathering --> what our customers want
Analysis --> Analyse the requirements
Design --> Start designing the project, customers will accept the designing
Develop/implementation --> Implement the designing
Deployment
Test --> Test the design and everything
Maintainance --> 

ChatGPT
---------
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. It ensures that the software meets quality standards and customer requirements. The SDLC typically involves several phases:

1. Planning: Define the scope, objectives, and resources needed. Develop a project plan and schedule.

2. Analysis: Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders. Document what the system needs to do.

3. Design: Create architectural and detailed designs for the system. This includes defining system components, user interfaces, and data structures.

4. Development: Write and compile the code based on the design specifications. This phase involves actual coding and unit testing.

5. Testing: Evaluate the system to find and fix bugs. Perform various tests such as integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

6. Deployment: Release the software to the production environment where it can be used by end-users.

7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates. Address any issues or enhancements needed post-deployment.

Different methodologies can be applied to these phases, such as Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps, depending on the project's needs and goals.

Waterfall --> water is falling to down
Construction is over --> but testing is failed, output is not as per the design
Demolish the house, start again

50% construction is over --> now customer wants some change in design

disadvantages
---------------
it can't accomodate new requirements
final product output is only at the end

IT--> Waterfall
----------------
students = developers
parents = clients
teachers = testing team

developers, testers, clients

2 or 3 years

developers = no development from DAY-1
testers = no testing from DAY-1
clients = worried

after 1 year they start serious development

few employees will resign, new employees will come = KT

started development

testing what to do? reading 100's of pages from client requirement and planning test cases...

development is completed in DEV env, developers tesed it is good

testing environment --> under pressure. raise more and more defects

started fights between developers and testers

100 defects --> 80 defects valid, 20 defects invalid

lot of emails between developers and testers..involving team leaders.. involving managers .. account head

clients == Ferrari (Client Expenctation) == Maruthi 800 (Actually Developed)

main disadvantage in watefall --> you cannot insert new requirements. you have to wait until the final product is delivered.

Agile
--------
start with small things --> keep short goals
divide the system into small modules
signup and login
product catalogue
cart
payment
delivery

sprints and modules

Sprint-1 may be for 1 month
---------------------------
signup and login

developers = they start from DAY-1 = 1.5 week for development
testers = 1.5 week for testing
1 week for deployment

1.5 weeks = developers concentration is more
testers = focus is less during 1.5 of weeks of development because product is not ready and vice versa

10 defects --> 8 valid, 2 invalid

again same fight

90% completed, 10% pending

Sprint-2 product catalogue
---------------------------
10% backlog (complete 10% backlog of sprint 1 along with sprint 2)


Sprint-final
---------------------------
ferrari == Honda City


2016 --> too much load on servers (once jio came in 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------
daily slip test = daily testing

Sprint-1 = process improvement
-------------------------------
DAY-1 he developed a code for

Enter your First Name

DAY-1 ask testing team to test this small code

positive and negative

1. enter the name in 20 char
2. enter the numbers in the name field

10 test cases --> 

DAY-2 ==> no chance of raising invalid defects. 3 valid defects.
Developers and testers will communicate


if the code developed is built and tested on the same day then you can call it as DevOps ==> We use tools to make it fast and reliable

1. Faster releases to the market
2. Less defects

amazon vs flipkart
-------------------
every 11.2sec they do one release, fully automated with less defects

manual testing --> automated testing
build and deployment --> 

deployment --> automate
------------
1.0 --> running

download the new version
stop the sytem
remove old version
instal new version
start the system

DevOps and cloud two wheels for a bike
--------------------------------------


Server
---------
Windows vs Linux --> Linux
Super computers also use linux

everything is command here --> everything is text

Linux can run for years without restart
less power
less bandwidth
less memory
100% free
fast

We will start learning Linux

AWS account create --> free trail
500-1000rs per month
if more bill --> ask AWS they will refund
1Lakh --> please refund
