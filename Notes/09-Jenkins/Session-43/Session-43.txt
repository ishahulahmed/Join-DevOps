Long Term Support Release
---------------------------
Here, I have sudo for every command as per jenkins documentation. but, you can just use sudo su - command and execute commands without out sudo for every command.

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

This is not working may be some OS Issue Siva Said Giving Error as
--2024-08-26 11:41:26--  https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
Resolving pkg.jenkins.io (pkg.jenkins.io)... 146.75.34.133, 2a04:4e42:78::645

GnuTLS: One of the involved algorithms has insufficient security level.
Unable to establish SSL connection.

So, Siva kept this https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo (go to this url and copy content and use vim) manually in /etc/yum.repos.d/
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
vim jenkins.repo
[jenkins]
name=Jenkins-stable
baseurl=http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable
gpgcheck=1

save the above content

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade (it will take lot of time and not recommended also)
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk (java is mandatory) (use -y for auto approve)
sudo yum install jenkins (-y at the end for auto approve)
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start Jenkins
--------------
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

You Can Use Terraform Module or Shell Script to Install Jenkins

In browser your instance public-ip:8080

You will jenkins sign-in page with path to find your password /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword 

cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

In Jenkins everything is treated as a job.
a) trigger the job 
b) Pre Build (Setting Build Environment comes under Pre Build)
c) Build
d) Post Build

Freestyle means login into the console and doing our required job.

freestyle disadvantages (disadvantage when we do through console)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. anyone can login and do the changes, difficult to track what went wrong
2. difficult to restore
3. I can't see the history, no versions

scripted way
-------------
1. review can be done before do something.
2. easy to restore
3. track the changes
4. maintains the history

Now, most of the people are opting for pipeline jobs not through freestyle jobs.

1 acre --> 1 person do
100 acres -> He employs resources

distributing the work to diff resources...

Jenkins is a master node.

install agents and distribute the pipelines to the agents...

Agent-1 --> windows environment
Agent-2 --> Mac environment
Agent-3 --> Chrome environment

master and slave (Before)
master and node (Agent) architecture (Now)

1. when work is there, master calls agent and ask them to do work
2. daily agent comes to master and ask if there is any work

agent should have java jdk kit installed in order to work
/var/lib/jenkins/ is the home folder of jenkins

15min to create application artifact zip/jar

1hr 15min --> application success  (use timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES') to set time limit)

when one person is performing something on the application, others should stop (use disableConcurrentBuilds() Function)

steps {
                echo "Hello ${params.PERSON}"

                echo "Biography: ${params.BIOGRAPHY}"

                echo "Toggle: ${params.TOGGLE}"

                echo "Choice: ${params.CHOICE}"

                echo "Password: ${params.PASSWORD}"
            }
			
How to configure github to jenkins webhook

system-1 something happend, we need to inform system-2  (Example ATM Withdrawl System to SMS System)
when events those can be notified.

when developer pushed code to github, we need to trigger the pipeline

pipeline{
	agent{
		label 'java-agent'
	}
	options{
		timeout(time: 30, unit: 'MINUTES')
	}
	environment{
		Greeting = 'Hello World'
	}
	parameters{
	
	}
	stages{
		stage('Build'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'
			}
		}
		stage('Test'){
			steps{
				sh 'echo this is build'
			}
		}
	}
	post{
		always{
		
		}
		success{
		
		}
		failure{
		
		}
	}
}

post section is after stages section
