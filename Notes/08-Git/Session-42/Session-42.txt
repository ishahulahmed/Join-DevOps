git reset
git revert

mostly these commands we should not use. But, there are situations when we you should use them. we will discuss about them today.

git reset vs git revert --> undo the changes done

you, should always pull the changes before you push.
cd /d/devops/repos/git-dosa
git checkout main
git pull origin main

Best Practise
---------------
before you raise PR, check main branch moved forward or not?
git checkout main
git pull origin main

pull before push --> recommended way (even before pushing your branch pull changes in main)

ChatGPT
-------
No, the changes in the main branch will not automatically reflect in your dosa branch after you switch back to it. When you create a branch, it takes a snapshot of the current state of the repository at that point in time.

To incorporate the changes from main into your dosa branch, you'll need to merge or rebase. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Merge:
   bash
   git checkout dosa
   git merge main
   
   This will bring the changes from main into your dosa branch, creating a new merge commit.

2. Rebase (if you prefer a linear history):
   bash
   git checkout dosa
   git rebase main
   
   This will replay your dosa branch commits on top of the latest commits from main.

Choose the method that best fits your workflow!!

Concept
--------
git checkout -b reset-revert
Switched to a new branch 'reset-revert'

our, busniess grown we thought to have new item 99 dosa. so we made samples to try it in our own shop
git add .; git commit -m "paneer curry" [not pushed to remote did locally only at shop still not launched]
git add .; git commit -m "added cheese" [doing locally only for our employees and owners to taste]
git add .; git commit -m "added butter" [doing locally]

git log --oneline
a304aa4 (HEAD -> reset-revert) added butter
583273b added cheese
e4ca200 paneer curry
1f46400 (origin/main, main) Merge pull request #4 from ishahulahmed/karam-egg-dosa
298a621 (origin/karam-egg-dosa) remove neyyi
4322c8a added oil
d2c90bb added 2 eggs
3f45f5d added extra karam
8572644 added neyyi
14f5301 Merge pull request #1 from ishahulahmed/karam-dosa
2052f25 (origin/karam-dosa, karam-dosa) added oil to karam dosa
467de17 added karam to dosa
587b8b9 started first with plain dosa

Suddenly, owner said that this all not good remove. 

Reset
-------
git reset (3 options)
1. soft
2. mixed
3. hard

index/staging/ temp area -> git add (we will add to staging area by git add command)

soft --> it will remove the commits, but keep the changes in staging area

git add .; git commmit -m ""

git reset --soft HEAD~1
