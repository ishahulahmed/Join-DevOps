git reset
git revert

git reset vs git revert --> undo the changes done

mostly these commands we should not use. But, there are situations when we you should use them. we will discuss about them today.

you, should always pull the changes before you push.
cd /d/devops/repos/git-dosa
git checkout main
git pull origin main

Best Strategy or Best Practise
-------------------------------
before you raise PR, check main branch moved forward or not?
git checkout main
git pull origin main

pull before push

Concept
--------
git checkout -b reset-revert
Switched to a new branch 'reset-revert'

our, busniess grown we thought to have new item 99 dosa. so we made samples to try it in our own shop
git add .; git commit -m "paneer curry" [not pushed to remote did locally only at shop still not launched]
git add .; git commit -m "added cheese" [doing locally only for our employees and owners to taste]
git add .; git commit -m "added butter" [doing locally]

git log --oneline
a304aa4 (HEAD -> reset-revert) added butter
583273b added cheese
e4ca200 paneer curry
1f46400 (origin/main, main) Merge pull request #4 from ishahulahmed/karam-egg-dosa
298a621 (origin/karam-egg-dosa) remove neyyi
4322c8a added oil
d2c90bb added 2 eggs
3f45f5d added extra karam
8572644 added neyyi
14f5301 Merge pull request #1 from ishahulahmed/karam-dosa
2052f25 (origin/karam-dosa, karam-dosa) added oil to karam dosa
467de17 added karam to dosa
587b8b9 started first with plain dosa

Suddenly, owner said that this all not good remove

Reset
-------
git reset (3 options)
1. soft
2. mixed
3. hard

index/staging/ temp area -> git add (we will add to staging area by git add command)

soft --> it will remove the commits, but keep the changes in staging area

git add .; git commmit -m ""

git reset --soft HEAD~1
