if you don't have any idea blindly go for merge.

even DevOps engineers will also get conflicts. Because, we are also developing scripts and pushing it to github. devops engineers will also creates branches and then if got approval then it is merged to main branch.

Git Branching Strategy is so much important. here we can differentiate easily one person is genuine or not.

Branching Strategy
---------------------
developers writing the code in non main/master branches. How it gets upto main/master branch. How the deployment happens in diff environments like DEV, SIT (Systems Integration Testing or QA Env), UAT, PERF (Performance), PRE-PROD, PROD, SEC (Security)

Environment depends on the projects. Usually, banking projects have lot of environments. small projects have less environments.

Waterfall Model
----------------------
https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ 
Written By Vincent Driessen (on Tuesday, January 05, 2010) at that time web applications were not popular he wrote the strategy about desktop applications.

Desktop applications --> Have to support multiple versions (disadvantage of Desktop application)
	windows 11, 10, 11.3
	Ms Office 2021, 2019, 2016, 2013 (Desktop Application has to support all these version because not everyone move to latest version)
		MS Office 2013 --> huge bug (now office 2021 is running but if 2013 got a bug the microsoft team will)
		get the code released for 2013 latest version
		resolve the bug
		release the patch
	MS Office 2024 (now they are launching office 2024)

one team will work for 2024. one for 2021 etc this was a complex procedure. i.e different teams working on different versions.

atleast 3 months to release the change 
		
Web applications --> there is no point of versions (for web applications no versions)

hotfix
----------------
main --> PROD
emergency bug --> 2000 2/-, redbus completely down
P0 --> SLA --> 30min
P1 --> ticket --> SLA --> Service level agreement --> 1hr
P4
hotfixes branches are directly merged to main branch and deployed to PROD

a small code change can fix the issue

DEV --> DEV Test --> QA --> QA testing --> UAT --> UAT testing --> PRE-PROD --> regeression testing, sanity testing --> PROD
1 week

hotfix/2024-06-05


main(long lived) branches --> main, development
source: main
destination:  main, development

development
----------------
development --> current development going on, it represents current state of the project development

source: main
destination: nothing

feature branches
-----------------
feature/ai-image-generator --> one team --> 10-JUN-2024
feature/call-recording --> another team --> 10-AUG-2024

source: development
destination: development

feature/ai-image-generator
--------------------
multiple persons --> should use merge

feature/ai-image-generator --> PR --> development

deploy to DEV environment --> developers will perform the testing from development side..

dev team lead confirms features are tested properly....

Build and Release team --> present they are called devops engineers

create one branch from development --> release branch

Release branch
------------------
source: development
destination: main, development
whatsapp: 5.3.1
upcoming release: 5.4.0 -> 10-JUN-2024
upcoming release: 5.5.0 -> 10-AUG-2024 --> call-recording and caller ID

release/5.4.0 --> deploy into QA --> QA team tests the code
from now on every body should work in this release branch only since it is fixed already.

lot of defects

QA team sign off --> clients will directly QA lead. first responsible person QA


Feature branching model/GitHub Flow
--------------------------
2 weeks/ 4 weeks

modules are independent projects...
web versions

one branch/feature --> one person -> rebase/ merge

price, description, date

include-date --> do the changes --> 

we have one release for every 2 weeks, we follow feature branching
main --> Production
feature branch from main branch
they do the development and deploy to DEV environment
if that is success, they will raise PR, if the PR is approve they merge changes to main branch.
then we perform QA and UAT deployment.
once we get QA and UAT sign off, we will deploy to PROD through CR process.

CR --> change request process

what are the changes in the release
what is the date and time of release
if failure, how can we rollback? what is the plan?
any downtime? --> yes/no
QA testing
UAT testing
Scans
Delivery manager from TCS
QA manager
Client approval

deployment window --> 10-JUN-2024 03:00-04:00 AM

deployment failed, CR failed

why it is failed, stop the next sprint

RCA --> Root cause analysis

1. you are working on latest modern things from the beginning
2. you worked on legacy things, you were part of migrating from legacy to modern
