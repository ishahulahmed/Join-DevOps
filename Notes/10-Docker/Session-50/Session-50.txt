How to get the terminal access of running container

docker exec -it container-id bash

docker inspect container-id/image-id
docker logs

Dockerfile -->it is the declarative way of creating custom images

Shell --> keep all the commands in a file and run it...

Dockerfile --> keep all the instructions a file i.e Dockerfile and build the image.

Docker image = BaseOS+ App run time+ system packages and application dependencies + app code

docker build -t url/username/image-name:tag . --> will check for Dockerfile

FROM
-----
from should be the first instruction to represent base os
FROM image-name:tag

RUN
-----
We wil use RUN instruction to install packages and configure them. RUN instruction wll execute at the time of image creation.

CMD
-----
this instruction will run at the time of container creation.

systemctl start backend --> then only you can access backend application

whatever the instruction you give in image to run as container, should run for infinite time.
CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]

systemctl will not work in containers and images.

CMD 

docker run -it --> create container and login inside...
docker exec -it

RUN vs CMD
-----------
RUN --> executes at build time means image creation time
CMD --> only executes at the time of container creation i.e docker run


LABEL
---------
1000 white covers, label the covers

EXPOSE
---------
expose instruction will let the users know what are the ports used by image/container

How can you push the image to docker-hub
-----------------------------------------
url/username/image-name:tag

you can push images to docker hub, nexus, ECR, jfrog,etc.

url=docker.io

joindevops/expose:1.0

docker push joindevops/expose:1.0
docker login

joindevops/label:v1.0.0

docker tag joindevops/label:v1.0.0 lable.nexus.joindevops.com/sivakumar/label:v1


ENV
----
FROM
ENV trainer="sivakumar"\
    course="docker" \
	duration="100hr"


COPY vs ADD
-------------
COPY and ADD both are to copy the files from workspace to docker image. but ADD have 2 extra advantages

1. It can directly download content from internet into the image
2. It can directly untart the files into the image.
