What is YAML?
--------------
a) YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. 
b) Depending on whom you ask, YAML stands for yet another markup language or YAML ain't markup language (a recursive acronym), which emphasizes that YAML 
   is for data, not documents.

What is Markup Language?
--------------------------
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations can define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and other content types, providing instructions for how to display or process the text.

--> Similar to XML & JSON
--> In YAML, you can store only data, not commands (if this do that..)

Data Serialisation
